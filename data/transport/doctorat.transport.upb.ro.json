        "text": "Professor Crainic is a member of the Royal Society of Canada – The Academies of Arts, Humanities and Sciences of Canada. He co-founded, in 1991, the TRISTAN – Trienial Symposium on Transportation Analysis and, in 2000, the Odysseus – International Workshop on Freight Transportation and Logistics series of international meetings. He contributes to several editorial boards. He was President of the Transportation Science and Logistics Society of INFORMS, Director of the Centre for Research on Transportation (currently CIRRELT), and received the 2006 Merit Award of the Canadian Operational Research Society. The research interests of Professor Crainic are in network, integer, and combinatorial optimization, meta-heuristics, and parallel computing applied to the planning and management of complex systems, particularly in transportation and logistics. Major contributions target the design, scheduling, and operations of consolidation-based transportation systems and services, including uncertainty, resource, and revenue management considerations; routing and scheduling of vehicles; Intelligent Transportation Systems; City Logistics; new business and organizational transportation and logistics models and systems; and planning of urban and inter-urban multimodal multi-stakeholder freight transportation systems at all geographic scales. Professor Crainic published over 290 scientific papers and chapters, and has a h-index of 79 (Google Scholar). He co-edited the Network Design with Applications in Transportation and Logistics book published by Springer in 2021, as well as numerous special issues of major scientific journals. He supervised over 160 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Walter Rei is a Professor of Operations Research at the Department of Analytics, Operations, and Information Technologies of the École des Sciences de la Gestion, Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada. He currently holds the Canada Research Chair in Stochastic Optimization of Transport and Logistics Systems and he is also a member of the Interuniversity Research Centre on Enterprise Networks,Logistics and Transportation (CIRRELT). His research interests center on the development of efficient solution methodologies for integer stochastic programs and combinatorial optimization models relevant to transportation and logistics problems.",
